# Master in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

This repository will be an index to all the courses I will take during my studies. I will make sure to make everything I study and practice public, so that everyone can study and learn from my mistakes or experiences. 

Since I want each course to be **indipendent**, this will just be a **book cover** with a link to other repositories that will contain more information.

**To follow this course you must have a good foundation in mathematics (Analysis I and II, Linear Algebra, advanced mathematical methods and models), statistics (probability calculation, statistical inference, data analytics, excellent knowledge of R) and programming (excellent knowledge of C and Python, advanced programming, algorithms and data structures, system optimizations)**

Feel free to ask me questions, correct me or advise me.
