# Master in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

This repository will be an index to all the courses I will take during my studies. I will make sure to make everything I study and practice public, so that everyone can study and learn from my mistakes or experiences. 

Since I want each course to stand alone, this will just be a book cover with a link to other repositories that will contain more information.

Feel free to ask me questions, correct me or advise me.
