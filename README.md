# Master in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

As per description, entire master's course in data science and artificial intelligence at the University of Trieste, academic year 2024/2025 (and subsequently 2025/2026). 

To give a bit of background, I graduated from the three-year course in "Artificial intelligence and data analytics", also held at the University of Trieste. Before that, in high school I completed an ITIS diploma in Information Technology and Telecommunications. Everyone can try to study and follow the topics I will upload, since they are not necessarily behind walls of theory. However, you need to have some basic knowledge. Everything will be better indicated further down.

Link to the course for more information [here](https://dsai.units.it/)

**To follow this course you must have a good foundation in mathematics (Analysis I and II, Linear Algebra, advanced mathematical methods and models), statistics (probability calculation, statistical inference, data analytics, excellent knowledge of R) and programming (excellent knowledge of C and Python, advanced programming, algorithms and data structures, system optimizations)**

This repository will be an index to all the courses I will take during my studies. I will make sure to make everything I study and practice public, so that everyone can study and learn from my mistakes or experiences. 
Since I want each course to be **indipendent**, this will just be a **book cover** with a link to other repositories that will contain more information.

Feel free to ask me questions, correct me or advise me.
